             <p>Our mission is to provide an efficient and user-friendly platform for managing student results, simplifying the process of recording and tracking academic performance in educational institutions.
              Our goal is to make it easier for educational institutions to keep track of student achievements and progress.
             </p>
             <p>The main objective of this project is to provide a platform where teachers can easily publish result of students and students can easily get their result.
            The project is totally built at administration end and thus only the administrator is guaranteed the access.
             Admin can login and add marks/delete marks/update marks/see all the student's data and also can see the messages from any students.
             Students can get their result by entering their roll no. and class.</p>
